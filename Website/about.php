      <p class="section3-text" style="color:black;margin-left: 25px;">Ourz was born in a small office in the backyard of Dor's house in 2020, shortly after the onset of the Corona panademic. Workplaces were closed, people abandoned the luxurious office towers and were transferred, not always voluntarily, to work from home. The same backyard office,
 		which until that time had stood empty, began to be bustling with life. The studies, the work, the chores, the phone calls and the zoom meetings - almost everything moved to take place there. The relatively new center of life.
		At that moment the insight was clear - why such a space, which could fulfill all the work and study needs of everyone, and at all times, stood empty until now? How many more such workspaces are around us? How much unused space? How far have we come so far to sit in a small office in the heart of a central city that we could do exactly the same
		job a few minutes away from home? Hence the way to formulate the idea was short and precise. An online platform for brokering homeowners including unused workspaces for casual office tenants. Without long leases, without travel and traffic jams, without paying when we are not physically there, without the noise of cafes, without parking, without
		a limited geographical spread to major cities. It is simply an office available anywhere and anytime.
		The word Ourz, a combination of Hours (hours) and Ours (ours) tells the idea concisely. There are no more annual contracts where we pay for an office even if we are not there. From now on you only pay when you are, even if it is for an hour. From today my office at home is also your office.
